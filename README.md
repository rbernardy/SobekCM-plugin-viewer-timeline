# SobekCM-plugin-viewer-timeline
<p>SobekCM-plugin-viewer-MODEL3D is a plugin for the open-source SobekCM Digital Repository software (Mark V. Sullivan, lead developer). It provides a viewer for 3D model content using 3DHOP, a HTML5-WebGL viewer created by Marco Potenziani and Marco Callieri.</p>
<p>At the alpha development stage.</p>
<p>This version of the plugin was a proof-of-concept version. It uses existing metadata items which have been edited to include a timeline set number as an identifier. This of course is not practical for all uses as the typical users won't have editing privileges on all items they wish to include in their timeline. The next phase of development will be to create a custom metadata module to provide a behavior to add items to your timeline and have the ability to override existing metadata.</p>
